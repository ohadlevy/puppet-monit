Taken from http://mmonit.com/monit:
monit is a utility for managing and monitoring, processes, files, directories
and devices on a UNIX system. Monit conducts automatic maintenance and repair
and can execute meaningful causal actions in error situations.

in order to use this module you would need to include in your manifest somewhere:
class mymodule::myclass {
    include monit::common
}
if you would like to receive email notifications from monit for failed services/alerts please enter
BEFORE the include line the following line:

    # email address to send monit emails
	$monit_admin="my@email"
    include monit::common

Note: you probably need to change the monit template to include your smtp server

munin integration

If you already use munin,or you would like to use it, you could choose add the monit information to your munin graphs.
in order to that, just include monit::munin instead of monit::common 

additional monit files can be deployed in /etc/monit.d/
